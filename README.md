# Solver32-LiteVNA-V2Plus4
Solver32 is a 32-bit application for the LiteVNA as well as the V2Plus4.  It was developed using National Instruments LabView 2011.

With new management at National Instruments (or NI as they now identify themselves as), customers are now only offered subscription licenses for LabView.  These new licenses are not perpetual and expire each year.   The cost for me to develop with the 62-bit tools would have far exceeded what I am willing to pay to provide you with free software.  

Solver32 is my continued efforts to create software for the new LiteVNA but based on my 32-bit version of LabView.  If you are using any of my older software, you should already have the correct runtime engine and VISA installed.
